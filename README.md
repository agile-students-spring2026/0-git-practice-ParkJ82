# Create a local Git Repo

**paragraph**: Currently, developers are experiencing troubles and paradox with the use of AI. However, I found it interesting that Stanford made a class that encourages vibe coding. I had a feeling that traditionally elite universities would be pessimistic about these changes. The article really made me think that I have to be really flexible about future changes in order to survive and thrive in the real world.

**paragraph**: Alissa's Comment: This is very Stanford-aligned. I just went to a VC breakfast where we talked about modern AI coding tools, and how they make strong developers practically 1000x'd. AI tooling makes software etc faster and cheaper than ever, allowing founders to prototype, iterate, ship at record speeds. For a university that has such a strong founder culture, this demonstrates a strong alignment with the culture.
